# Conway-Game-of-Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

# Rules
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

# Usage
Run the file to generate states. On each prompt, type 'y' to generate the next state, 'n' to terminate program.

# About the Code
Conway's game of life has been coded on python. gol.py is the memory efficient version of gameoflife.py
